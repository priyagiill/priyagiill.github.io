		<main><p>Great folks in great places equal great happiness. At FLO, we’re all about building a comprehensive and caring community; an atmosphere you’ll invariably want to belong to. Co-living, along with providing an alternative to traditional housing models also unlocks a range of social benefits that help prevent or mitigate loneliness. Strong social networks, social cohesion, pro-environmental behavior and a sense of belonging among residents are a few of these! In a time of increasing digital dependence, FLO is breathing life back into physical communities. Residents—or as FLO calls it, FLOmates—will find and contribute to a vibrant circle of bright minds. We have curated a calendar of events ranging from regular movies nights, game nights, cricket matches, bowling nights, treks, potlucks, outings and get togethers! It all boils down to one overarching goal that our FLOmates truly “Love Where They Live” Our FLO values are:</p>
